# Why am I not using Github anymore?
### Isn't it the most well-known git hosting platform? The most user friendly one?

Well, I guess.\
But also, there's Copilot. I don't like Copilot.\
I'm not gonna talk about politics here, so I'll skip the moral and ecological considerations.\
** Addendum - 07/02/2026 **\
I recently learned that Github was contracted with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The only things considered "political" are those that can be debated. ICE being responsible of multiple violations of human rights is not debatable, and therefore not political. I urge everyone reading this to account for this fact when considering continuing to use Github.\
I personally don't like Copilot, because I enjoy programming! I enjoy every single part of it - yes, even the long tedious boilerplate - even the rewriting of a generic function I've already written a bajillion times before. I love every single part of it. I don't want a machine to do any of that for me, ever.

### "But isn't that naive? Won't you get fired/pointed out as unhirable because others write code faster?"
Maybe.\
But first of all, I don't think a good programmer is one that writes code quickly. A good programmer is one that writes quality code.\
What do I call quality code?
- Code that runs fast
- Code that doesn't leak every user's personal data the second it gets put on prod
- And most of all, code that is easily maintainable - by others, and by you in 15 years when you read through it again with fresh eyes and new tools.

Second, woodworkers still exist, despite there being hundreds of factories pumping out generic furniture at every hour of the day, everywhere on Earth.\
This is what I want to be. link strive to become a master craftsman, someone who produces code of such a quality that I'll be worth the time an employer spends on me.\
** Addendum - 07/02/2026 **\
At the time of writing this, I have now worked with enough people who use AI assistants for enough time to confidently say that the time they use to review/correct/regenerate their code makes me as fast as them, for better results.\
\
What about in the meantime, though?\
Well, the more I do things myself, the faster I learn, and the faster I'll get there.

### "How about contributions to other bigger projects? Those that still use Github?"
I don't really have a choice but to stay here to contribute if necessary.\
I don't like Copilot, but I love and deeply respect the [Libre Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) community.\
Hopefully, all these cool projects move to better platforms as time passes! I know a few have already started using Gitlab.
\
\
\
This isn't about Copilot in particular. I don't think AI coding assistants in general are a constructive thing to use - at least not if you're aiming for the top.\
At the school where I study computer science, I've seen dozens and dozens of students become technologically illiterate the second their AI's are taken from them.\
And even when you give those back to them, they stay average at best. At worst, they produce barely maintainable bug piles.
\
Therefore, I will not let these assistants proliferate using what I make.\
I don't believe the hype is gonna keep up for long, anyway.

You can find most of my code updated way more often than on here on [my sourcehut page](https://git.sr.ht/~ae7th).\
Sourcehut is (among other things) a git hosting platform that has a strong anti-AI stance.
