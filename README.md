# Why am I not using Github anymore?
### Isn't it the most well-known? The most user friendly?

Well, I guess.\
But also, there's Copilot. I don't like Copilot.
I'm not gonna talk about politics here, so I'll skip the moral and ecological considerations.
I personally don't like Copilot, because I enjoy programming! I enjoy every single part of it - yes, even the long tedious boilerplate - even the rewriting of a generic function I've already written a bajillion times before. I love every single part of it. I don't want a machine to do any of that for me, ever.

### "But isn't that naive? Won't you get fired/pointed out as unhirable because others write code faster?"
Maybe.
But first of all, I don't think a good programmer is one that writes code quickly. A good programmer is one that writes quality code.
What do I call quality code?
- Code that runs fast
- Code that doesn't leak every user's personal data the second it gets put on prod
- And most of all, code that is easily maintainable - by others, and by you in 15 years when you read through it again with fresh eyes and new tools.

Second, woodworkers still exist, despite there being hundreds of factories pumping out generic furniture at every hour of the day, everywhere on Earth.
This is what I want to be. I strive to become a master craftsman, someone who produces code of such a quality that I'll be worth the time an employer spends on me.
\
What about in the meantime, though?
Well, the more I do things myself, the faster I learn, and the faster I'll get there.

This isn't about Copilot in particular. I don't think AI coding assistants in general are a constructive thing to use - at least not if you're aiming for the top.
At the school where I study computer science, I've seen dozens and dozens of students become technologically illiterate the second their AI's are taken from them.
And even when you give those back to them, they stay average at best. At worst, they produce barely maintainable bug piles.
\
Therefore, I will not let these assistants proliferate using what I make.
I don't believe the hype is gonna keep up for long, anyway.

You can find most of my code updated way more often than on here on [my sourcehut page](https://git.sr.ht/~ae7th).
Sourcehut is (among other things) a git hosting platform that has a strong anti-AI stance.
